### It is an ever evolving, live document of Me.               ![logo](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20434999/24330347/a29dfe36-1267-11e7-9f7f-37615dca5d9b.png)

I created this site in response to a project task for my Diploma in Software Development, Feb-Aug 2017. My intention is to make this live document evolve as I do, recording my journey as a developer. 

# Design Consideratons

## Audience
This site was created under the brief that it is a display piece and entry point for prospective employers to my work. The "hero" photo I chose as representative of my professional approach and fun-loving, approachable demeanour.

## Design Decisons
The uncomplicated design was inspired by photojournalism, fashion and design websites, to convey elegance. A fan of Chanel and photography, black and white was a clear choice. I wanted to bring in a pop of colour but couldn't find a combination which matched my personality. I have a saying "There is too much black and white in people's thinking; there needs to be more gray". So, I have used gray tones from my suit jacket in the hero photo as the grouping or encapsulation mechanism.
