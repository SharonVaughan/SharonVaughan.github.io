Developer

I studied computing because my mum said “There is a future in computers” some 30 years ago. She was somewhat correct in her clairevoyance. I, however, went for a wonder through the arts for a couple of decades, finding a serial academic love of learning.

My journey to Developer started May 2016 - RailGirls was amazing.
